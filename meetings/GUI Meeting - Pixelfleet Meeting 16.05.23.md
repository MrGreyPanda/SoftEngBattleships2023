## TODO when enough time

- Use a special feet flag to use feet as ships
- have a check for special feet ship config. If yes, instantly win the game

## TODO in the GUI

- Fixpoint in DragableObject not centered but most left gridpoint
- Rotation just in one direction (R)
- Return x, y Grid coords in DragableObject when released, also set Ship.is_placed_ = true
- when taken of grid (reset position) set Ship.is_placed_ = false
- Assets loading into Ship or assigning each ship a unique identifier (same as DragableObject)
